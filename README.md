# Automated-Error-Handling
This project focuses on streamlining incident response by mapping naming conventions across CTWO workflows and Jira process names. The goal was to support a Power Automate solution that monitors error email alerts, automatically creates Jira tickets with relevant information, and triggers a restart of the associated CTWO workflow.
